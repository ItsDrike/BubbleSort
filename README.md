# BubbleSort

This uses **pygame** to visualize Bubble Sort algorithm.
I decided to use line length as distinctive feature which will get sorted for best list/array visualization.

## Final result

Example list: `[12, 58, 21, 13, 18, 42, 35, 49, 10, 3, 50, 28, 55, 1, 8, 3, 24, 49]`

Result:

## Colors

* <span style="color:#00e9ff">**Blue**</span>: These values weren't changed (they're in correct order in respect to each other)
* <span style="color:#ff0000">**Red**</span>: These values were swapped (they weren't in the correct order)
* <span style="color:#00ff00">**Green**</span>: These values are already sorted and they won't be moved
